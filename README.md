### Group Project 5: Choose-your-own-adventure Hackathon

We've chosen the Intel Image Classification Kaggle challenge for our hackathon. More details can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification), but essentially, it's a challenge to classify 150x150 color images of natural features among 6 target classes. We will try a variety of approaches to see how high we can get our classification accuracy.

The notebook for this project is available [here](./project-5.ipynb).
